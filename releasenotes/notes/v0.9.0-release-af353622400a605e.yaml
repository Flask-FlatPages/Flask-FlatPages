prelude: >
    This is another maintenance release, preparing for work to add new features
    in the new year. It includes some small changes to private APIs. Breaking changes
    will be reserved for an eventual 1.0 release.
features:
  - |
    This release includes small imrpovements to developer experience enabled
    by dropping support for earlier Python versions. This includes type-hinting
    for most methods, with the exception of the renderer functions.
deprecations:
  - |
    This release drops support for Python <3.8; as well as these versions being EoL
    for at least 2 years, they also represent minimal fractions of usage according
    to PyPI stats (e.g. <0.25% of downloads were from Python 2.7). v0.8.3 will remain
    available for those unable to upgrade in the short term.
other:
  - |
    Removing access to the app instance via ``FlatPages.app`` will be delayed to a future
    release. The warning remains in place, to encourage users to update their code to avoid
    this pattern.
