  Small release to remove support for older Python versions, and to do some
  housekeeping on the project repository and contributor experience.

  Changes include:

    + Moving CI from Travis to Github Actions
      This decision was made following Travis CIs recent change in policies
      around open source projects.

    + Moving to Github Actions gave us the ability to define slightly more
      granular workflows, which give more insight into why tests failed and put
      CI results directly in Github.

    + ``Tox`` as a single entrypoint for all main developer tasks, specifically
      linting, testing and building docs.

    + Updated contribution guidelines
deprecations:
  - |
    This release drops support for Python versions 3.4 and 3.5. Support for python
    3.4 was dropped from Pip in July 2019, and support for 3.5 in January of this
    year. According to `PyPI Stats <https://pypistats.org/packages/flask-flatpages>`_.
    these versions account for a handful of downloads a month. Version 0.7.2 has
    identical funcitonality to this release and will still work for these versons.
fixes:
  - |
    This release resolves issue `#79 <https://github.com/Flask-Flatpages/Flask-Flatpages/issues/79>`_.
    by correcting an inconsistent parameter name in the documentation.
  - |
    Building on the fix to Issue `#77 <https://github.com/Flask-FlatPages/Flask-FlatPages/issues/77>`_, we
    replace the custom compact module with ``six``.
