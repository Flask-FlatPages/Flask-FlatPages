    In line with the `Flask Extension Guidelines`_, this release deprecates
    accessing the configured application instance via the FlatPages instance.

    In versions 0.9 and up, the .app property will instead wrap ``flask.current_app``,
    and thus raise a RuntimeError if it's accessed without an Application Context
    pushed. Please see the `Flask docs`_` for more details on managing this
    context
