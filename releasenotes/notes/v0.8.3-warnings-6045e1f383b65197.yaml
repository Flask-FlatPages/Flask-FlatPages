    In line with the `Flask Extension Guidelines`_, this release deprecates
    accessing the configured application instance via the FlatPages instance.

    In versions 0.9 and up, the .app property will instead wrap ``flask.current_app``,
    and thus raise a RuntimeError if it's accessed without an Application Context
    pushed. Please see the `Flask docs`_` for more details on managing this
    context

    Correct a typo in the optional-dependencies block. The test suite has also been updated
    to use the project dependencies directly rather than a hardcoded list in the tox config.

    This release includes explicit testing for Python 3.13, and drops support for Python 3.6.
    As off November 2024, PyPI Stats reports no installations on Python 3.6.
