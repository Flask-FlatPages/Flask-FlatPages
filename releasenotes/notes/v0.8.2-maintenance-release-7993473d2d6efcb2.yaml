prelude: >
    This is a maintenance release to give some much-needed TLC to the project.
    It primarily address operational issues like docs, testing, supported python
    versions, and packaging with setuptools.
deprecations:
  - >
    Python 2.7 is still currently supported, however due to end of support
    we will no longer automatically test changes against Python 2.7. At present,
    according to pypi-stats, Python  2.7 accounts for ~3% of users. Support will be
    dropped for the eventual 1.0 release. 
  - >
    Python 3.6 and 3.7 are still supported and tested against, but are considered
    End-Of-Life. Future releases will drop support for these versions. If you are still
    using Python <3.8, please consider upgrading.
fixes:
  - >
    Incoporated a suggestion from Issue
    `#85 <https://github.com/Flask-FlatPages/Flask-FlatPages/issues/85>`_,
    ensuring that paths are displayed if an error is encountered parsing the
    metadata with the updated metadata parser.
