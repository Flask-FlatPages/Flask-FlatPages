prelude: >
  This release includes three PRs. One adds a new attribute to the
  ``Page`` class, one improves our documentation, and the third improves the
  metadata parsing to make it consistent with other 'FlatPage' style libraries,
  and less fussy for cases like no page metadata.
features:
  - |
    Added ``Page.folder`` as a convencience attribute to the
    ``Page`` class.
  - |
    Improved metadata parsing, documented above.
upgrade:
  - |
    This version adds a new method for parsing Metadata. While it passes
    new and existing tests, there may still be bugs. As well as reporting
    issues, you can use the ``FLATPAGES_LEGACY_META_PARSER`` setting to
    revert to the old behaviour.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolves issue
    `#59 <https://github.com/Flask-FlatPages/Flask-FlatPages/issues/59>`_, by updating
    our metadata parser.
