Developer’s How To
==================

Tools
-----

Optinal, for testing:

    $ pip install pytest pytest-cov

For releasing:

    $ pip install tox Sphinx Sphinx-PyPI-upload


Running tests
-------------

Either one of:

    $ python -m flask_flatpages.tests
    $ py.test
    $ py.test --cov flask_flatpages --cov-report term-missing

pytest gives debugging help, integration with coverage, etc.
Other testing frameworks should work too.


Making a new release
--------------------

* Update check MANIFEST.in and package_data in setup.py if non-Python files
  were added.
* Update install_requires in setup.py if dependencies changed.
* Check that tests pass in all supported Python versions (2.5, 2.6 and 2.7;
  PyPY if you like.) tox can do this automatically, assuming that the
  interpreters are installed:

      $ tox

* Bump the version number in flask_flatpages/__init__.py
* Update the docs and changelog in docs/index.rst
* Rebuild the docs, check that _build/html/index.html looks good:

      $ python setup.py build_sphinx

* Upload the docs to PyPI:

      $ python setup.py

* Make and upload the release archive:

      $ python setup.py sdist upload upload_sphinx

* Tag the release and push to GitHub:

      $ git tag v0.X  # Same version number as in flask_flatpages/__init__.py
      $ git push
      $ git push --tags
